# Sample Slang App
This is the basic app with Slang integration. The app itself does not do anything other than initialize slang and launch an empty activity

To use this app, 

* Signup/signin to the Slang Console - https://console.slanglabs.in
* Create a Slang buddy there
* Use the app_id and app_key generated for that buddy/account and modify the entries here - https://github.com/SlangLabs/sample_empty_app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/in/slanglabs/sample_mock/VoiceInterface.java#L23
* Build and run this app
